# **Mini**

_A lightweight toolkit for training language models in PyTorch._

Mini is a modular framework for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating
transformer-based language models. It is designed to support
sequence-to-sequence learning tasks such as **next-word prediction**,
**instruction tuning**, and **text generation**.

## **Key Features**

- **Pre-training on structured & unstructured text**
- **Fine-tuning for instruction-based tasks** _(coming soon)_
- **Evaluation with perplexity and future metric support** _(BLEU, ROUGE, etc.)_
- **Easy CLI interface for training, inference, and evaluation**
- **Support for model checkpointing & resuming**
- **Optimized training with RMSNorm, SiLU activation, and learnable embeddings**

## **Architecture**

Mini follows a transformer-based architecture with a simplified and efficient
design:

- **`MiniEmbedding`** â€“ Learns both token and positional embeddings.
- **`MiniAttention`** â€“ Implements scaled dot-product self-attention.
- **`MiniBlock`** â€“ Stacks self-attention and feedforward layers.
- **`MiniTransformer`** â€“ A lightweight sequence-to-sequence model.
- **`RMSNorm`** â€“ Stabilizes training by normalizing activations.
- **`FeedForward`** â€“ Non-linear transformations with SiLU activation.

The current implementation focuses on **pre-training** with a learnable
embedding block. Future iterations may include **RoPE (Rotary Positional
Encoding)** and **adaptive attention mechanisms**.

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teleprint-me/mini.git
cd mini
```

### **2. Install dependencies**

```sh
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Prepare a dataset**

```sh
file data/mini-owl.md
wc -c data/mini-owl.md
```

**NOTE:** Any plaintext file will work. `mini-owl.md` is used for isolated and
controlled experimentation. See [training.md](docs/training.md) for more
information.

## **Usage**

### **Pre-training**

Train a model from scratch on a dataset:

```sh
python -m mini.cli.train \
    --dataset data/mini-owl.md \
    --processor models/tokenizer.model \
    --model models/mini.pt \
    --batch-size 2 \
    --batch-stride 8 \
    --num-epochs 100 \
    --save-every 10 \
    --num-layers 4 \
    --num-heads 8 \
    --head-dim 16 \
    --embed-dim 256 \
    --lr 1e-4 \
    --scheduler none \
    --bias \
    --verbose
```

### **Inference**

Run inference on a trained model:

```sh
python -m mini.cli.infer \
    --processor models/tokenizer.model \
    --model models/mini.pt \
    --prompt "The young bird listened"
```

### **Fine-tuning** _(coming soon)_

Fine-tune on an instruction-based dataset.

```sh

```

### **Evaluation** _(coming soon)_

Evaluate model performance with perplexity, BLEU, and other metrics.

```sh
# Placeholder for evaluation script
```

## **Development Roadmap**
